# Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

This repository contains two files that demonstrate various data visualization techniques using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries in Python. The files are:

1. **Seaborn for FIFA Dataset.pdf**  
2. **Types of plots in matplotlib.pdf**

## Files Overview

### 1. Seaborn for FIFA Dataset.pdf
This file contains a detailed walkthrough of how to use **Seaborn** for data visualization on the FIFA 19 dataset. It covers various types of plots, including:

- **Distributions**: Histograms, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots, and distplots.
- **Categorical Plots**: Countplots, stripplots, boxplots, violinplots, and barplots.
- **Relational Plots**: Scatterplots, lineplots, and regression plots.
- **FacetGrid and PairGrid**: For creating multi-plot grids.
- **Customization**: Controlling plot size, shape, and style.

The file also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the FIFA dataset, showcasing how to visualize player attributes like age, potential, and international reputation.

### 2. Types of plots in matplotlib.pdf
This file provides a comprehensive guide to creating various types of plots using **Matplotlib**. It includes examples and code snippets for the following plots:

- **Line Plot**: For displaying data points connected by lines.
- **Scatter Plot**: For showing individual data points in a 2D space.
- **Bar Plot**: For displaying rectangular bars representing data values.
- **Histogram**: For showing the distribution of a dataset.
- **Box Plot**: For displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary.
- **Heatmap**: For visualizing matrix-like data with colors.
- **Contour Plot**: For displaying the contours of a 3D surface in 2D.
- **Area Plot**: For showing shaded areas between lines.
- **Violin Plot**: Combines aspects of box plots and kernel density plots.
- **Stacked Bar Plot**: For displaying bars stacked on top of each other.
- **Error Bar Plot**: For displaying errors or uncertainty in data points.
- **3D Plot**: For creating 3D visualizations.
- **Pie Chart**: For displaying data as slices of a pie.
